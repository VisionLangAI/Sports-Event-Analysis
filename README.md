# Sports-Event-Analysis

The dataset represents a comprehensive collection of sociocultural, economic, and engagement indicators derived from global sporting events held between 2000 and 2024. It encompasses 70,000 observations across 21 variables, capturing diverse aspects such as gender representation, cultural diversity, public sentiment, sustainability, and social media engagement across multiple continents and event types, including the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, Asian Games, and Commonwealth Games. Each record reflects how demographic composition, cultural values, and regional characteristics influence public perception and overall social impact. The dataset integrates both quantitative and qualitative features, linking economic indicators like GDP per capita with social dimensions such as diversity scores and cultural engagement levels, thus enabling multidimensional analysis of the sociocultural impact of global sporting events.
